/*
 * Program 7.1:  Partioning.
 *
 *     The variable v holds the value of the partitioning element a[r], and i
 *     and j are the left and right scan pointers, respectively.  The partitioning
 *     loop increments i and decrements j, while maintaining the invariant
 *     prooperty that no elements to the left of i are greater than v and no
 *     elements to the right of j are smaller than v.  Once the pointers meet,
 *     we complete the partitioning by exchanging a[i] and a[r], which puts
 *     v into a[i], with no larger elements to v's right and no smaller elements
 *     to its left.
 *
 *     The partitioning loop is implemeneted as an infinite loop, with a
 *     break when the pointers cross.  The test j == l protects against the
 *     case that the partitioning element is the smallest element in the file.
